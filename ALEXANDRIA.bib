@article{typestosets,
	abstract = {Types in higher-order logic (HOL) are naturally interpreted as nonempty sets. This intuition is reflected in the type definition rule for the HOL-based systems (including Isabelle/HOL), where a new type can be defined whenever a nonempty set is exhibited. However, in HOL this definition mechanism cannot be applied inside proof contexts. We propose a more expressive type definition rule that addresses the limitation and we prove its consistency. This higher expressive power opens the opportunity for a HOL tool that relativizes type-based statements to more flexible set-based variants in a principled way. We also address particularities of Isabelle/HOL and show how to perform the relativization in the presence of type classes.},

@article{ballarin-exploring,
	abstract = {Locales, the module system of the theorem prover Isabelle, were designed so that developments in abstract algebra could be represented faithfully and concisely. Whether these goals were met is assessed through a case study. Parts of an algebra textbook, Jacobson's Basic Algebra, that are challenging structurally were formalised. Key parts of the formalisation are presented in greater detail. An analysis of the work from both qualitative and quantitative perspectives substantiates that the design goals were met. In particular, the size ratio of formal to ``pen and paper''text does not increase when going further into the book. The analysis also yields guidance on locales including patterns of use, which are identified and described.},
